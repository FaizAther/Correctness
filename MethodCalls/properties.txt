    ( i )   fusc(0) = 0
    (i i)   fusc(1) = 1
    (iii)   fusc(2 * n) = fusc(n)
    (i v)   fusc(2 * n + 1) = fusc(n) + fusc(n + 1)


    The Calkin-Wilf tree is a binary tree in
    which each positive rational number appears exactly once.
    A breadth-first traversal of the
    tree gives the following sequence of rational numbers
    1/1, 1/2, 2/1, 1/3, 3/2, 2/3, 3/1,
    1/4, 4/3, 3/5, 5/2, 2/5, 5/3, 3/4,
    ...whereeach denominator is the next numerator.
    The sequence of numerators (and hence denominators)
    can be calculated by the following functionfusc,
    i.e., fusc(n)corresponds to the numerator
    of the nth rational number (and hence the denominator of the
    (n-1)th rationalnumberwhen n > 1) in the sequence above.
